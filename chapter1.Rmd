# About me

I  Kiira, MSc and project researcher in UEF. I heard about the IODS-course from my team members who have previously taken the course. I am currently working with register-based patient data and therefore want to learn more regarding data analysis. I have previous experience in using R and during my studies in biomedicine we briefly discussed different dimension reduction and clustering methods (e.g. PCA, hierarchical clustering). I am awaiting to learn more during this course! 

My github repository is found [here](http://github.com/kiukkum/IODS-project/)
